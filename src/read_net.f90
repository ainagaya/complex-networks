program read_net
    ! This program reads a network from a file and calculates 
    ! structural properties of the netowrk such as the degree distribution,
    ! the clustering coefficient and the average degree.
    
    ! The network is read from a file with the following format:
    ! node1 node2

    ! The output is written to the output folder.
